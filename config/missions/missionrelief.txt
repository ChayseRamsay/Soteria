Attention USSN-Unity,

A minor natural disaster on a nearby Corporate facility has left the local staff desperate for aid. All departments on [station_name] are requested to provide as much medicine, food, minerals, equipment, and other supplies that they can spare for our allied facility.

All departments are strongly urged to participate in assisting with this endeavor. Supplies can be provided through your cargo shuttle.

Thank you,
Miranda Trasen
